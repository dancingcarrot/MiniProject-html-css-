				About Richard Branson
			</h1>

			

<p>
				☛ His business sold records for considerably less than the
                 "High Street" outlets, especially the chain WHSmith. 
                 Branson once said, "There is no point in starting your own business
                 unless you do it out of a sense of frustration."<br><br>
				☛ His first business venture, at the age of 16, 
                was a magazine called Student.<br><br>
				☛ He opened a chain of record stores,
                 Virgin Records—later known as Virgin Megastores—in 
                 1972.<br><br>
				☛ In 2004, he founded spaceflight corporation Virgin Galactic,
                 based at Mojave Air and Space Port in California,
                  noted for the SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane designed for space tourism.
				<br><br> ☛ For Branson, his long-standing motto,  <strong>'screw it, just do it'</strong> is the only way to break through 
                these barriers.
